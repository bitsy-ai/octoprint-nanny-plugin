# Platform Dependency Installation
#
# Ref: https://github.com/bitsy-ai/octoprint-nanny-plugin/issues/54
#
# Print Nanny depends on TensorFlow, which I distribute as a binary (whl) dynamically linked again libatlas
# That means the libatlas library MUST be installed and resolvable by ld (library linker) for the TensorFlow binary installer to succeed
# I took a ham-fisted approach to this problem by running `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev cmake python3-dev` in a subprocess during pip install
# Ref: https://github.com/bitsy-ai/octoprint-nanny-plugin/pull/35/files#diff-60f61ab7a8d1910d86d9fda2261620314edcae5894d5aaa236b821c7256badd7R84
#
# This isn't ideal because the OctoPi image (very reasonably) restricts passwordless sudo.
# For ref, here are the sudoers rules in the OctoPi image: https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/blob/2f51ef2dcb60508f25b47c4c2bc070ffe2b363df/src/modules/octopi/start_chroot_script#L155
#
# To move forward, I have three viable options:
#
# (Option 1)
# Provide instructions to add a passwordless sudo rule for Print Nanny
#
# This would look something like...
# $ echo "pi ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt" > /etc/sudoers.d/print-nanny-passwordless-apt
#
# This would open up a lot of attack surface on the user's system.
# ANY plugin or software running as the Pi user would be able to download packages and update package lists willy-nilly
# For example, a random LED light-blinker OctoPrint plugin could update the user's system to pull packages from a botnet repository instead of Raspbian's package repo
#
# Pros: "easy"
# Cons: Do you want ants? This is how we get ants.
# ┻━┻ ︵ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ︵ ┻━┻
#
# (Option 2)
# Vendor libatlas library and distribute it with Print Nanny
#
# Pros: apt permission is not required by Pi user
# Cons: I'll need to subscribe to libatlas's vulnerability mailing list and make sure I keep this library patched
